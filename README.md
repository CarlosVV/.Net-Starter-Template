# Concepts
* **Layers:** are about logical organization of code.
* **Tiers:** are the physical deployment of layers (only about where the code runs).
* **Cross-cutting concerns:** are aspects of a program that affect other concerns.
* **DRY:** Don't repeat yourself. "Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system". 
* **YAGNI:** You aren't gonna need it. "Always implement things when you actually need them, never when you just foresee that you need them".
* **TDD:** Test Driven Design.
* **DDD:** Domain Driven Design.
