# Layered Architectural Pattern
* Layered Architectures keep the Software flexible, more resilient to change.
* Allows you to change underlying technologies and implementations.
* Allow you to change how you package and deploy your application.

# Concepts
* **Layers:** are about logical organization of code
* **Tiers:** are the physical deployment of layers (only about where the code runs).
* **Don't repeat yourself**
