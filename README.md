# Tools
* **[ASP.NET Dynamic Data](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee845452.aspx)**: Dynamic Data enables you to create a data-driven Web site with little or no coding.

# Layered Architectural Pattern (separation of concerns)
* Layered Architectures keep the Software flexible, more resilient to change.
* Allows you to change underlying technologies and implementations.
* Allow you to change how you package and deploy your application.

# Domain Layer

# Presentation Layer

# Persistence Layer

# Application Services Layer

# Web Services Layer

# Data Transfer Objects

# Concepts
* **Layers:** are about logical organization of code.
* **Tiers:** are the physical deployment of layers (only about where the code runs).
* **Cross-cutting concerns:** are aspects of a program that affect other concerns.
* **DRY:** Don't repeat yourself. "Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system". 
* **YAGNI:** You aren't gonna need it. "Always implement things when you actually need them, never when you just foresee that you need them".
* **TDD:** Test Driven Design.
* **DDD:** Domain Driven Design.
* **Architecture:** Application architecture seeks to build a bridge between business requirements and technical requirements by understanding use cases, and then finding ways to implement those use cases in the software.
* **Single responsibility principle:** every module or class should have responsibility over a single part of the functionality provided by the software, and that responsibility should be entirely encapsulated by the class. "A class should have only one reason to change".
* **SOLID:** single responsibility, open-closed, Liskov substitution, interface segregation and dependency inversion. The intention is that these principles, when applied together, will make it more likely that a programmer will create a system that is easy to maintain and extend over time.
